Pavan Kumar Reddy Byreddy

I joined NWMSU family for this spring to pursue my Masters in Applied Computer Science and currently I am into my first semester of the graduation program. I will be graduating by 2020.

I'm from India. My experiences till date, academically, practically and professionally I realize, those experiences have subsequently bought me here to pursue my Masters in ACS at NWMSU. I worked as a Senior Software Engineer in Virtusa Consultancy Service Pvt ltd with 3 years of experience in Development, Implementation and Support Stages of various projects in Informatica, Oracle ADF, Java, Support and Maintenance.. I completed my under-graduation and diploma in Computer Science background. I feel that this course is a major step towards achieving my objectives and will help me acquire the versatility needed to reach my potential.

I would like to do some research in Machine learning & Web Mining while doing the course and after my graduation I want to work in real-time industries to get enough experience which will help me to achieve my long term goal i.e., Computer Science Professor.

My hobbies are having fun with coding, traveling.
